<li>Data Sources:</li>
<p>Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19ata constructs that the View uses to present the user with the look and feel of the application. Have a controller to maps user requests and handles them and calls the service if needed. And the service layer fetches the data from a covid-19 API, and here I use Commons CSV to reads and writes files in variations of the Comma Separated Value (CSV) format from the API. Technology: Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap

<li> Explaination </p>
In my application, I have a model, which represents formal underlying data constructs that the View uses to present the user with the look and feel of the application. Have a controller to maps user requests and handles them and calls the service if needed. And the service layer fetches the data from a covid-19 API, and here I use Commons CSV to reads and writes files in variations of the Comma Separated Value (CSV) format from the API.
